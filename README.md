# My Dotfiles [![CI](https://github.com/simeg/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simeg/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Test](https://github.com/simeg/dotfiles/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/simeg/dotfiles/actions/workflows/test.yml)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. My dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I master my life. My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless.

## üé® Starship Theme Management

This repository includes multiple starship themes and a convenient theme switcher:

### Available Themes

- **enhanced** - Full-featured theme with all modules (git metrics, language versions, etc.)
- **simple** - Balanced theme with essential info but not overwhelming
- **minimal** - Clean and fast prompt with only directory and git branch
- **neon** - Vibrant theme with bright colors and modern styling
- **rainbow** - Colorful theme with gradient effects and rich visual elements

### Theme Commands

```bash
starship-theme list              # List all available themes
starship-theme current           # Show current active theme
starship-theme set minimal       # Switch to minimal theme
starship-theme preview enhanced  # Preview theme configuration
starship-theme backup           # Backup current configuration
starship-theme restore          # Restore from backup
```

### Adding Your Own Themes

```bash
# Add a new theme from an existing .toml file
starship-theme add mytheme ~/path/to/my-starship.toml

# Or manually copy to themes directory
cp my-theme.toml starship/themes/
starship-theme set my-theme
```

### Theme Structure

Themes are stored in `starship/themes/` as `.toml` files. Each theme file should:
- Start with a descriptive comment (e.g., `# üåü Minimal Theme`)
- Be a valid starship configuration
- Include appropriate module settings

## üîç Validation & Troubleshooting

The `validate.sh` script checks:
- ‚úÖ All symlinks are correctly created
- ‚úÖ Required tools are installed
- ‚úÖ Zsh plugins are loaded
- ‚úÖ Git configuration is set
- ‚úÖ Neovim configuration is working
- ‚úÖ PATH includes custom bin directory

### Common Issues

**Symlinks not working?**
```bash
./scripts/symlink.sh  # Recreate symlinks
```

**Plugins not loading?**
```bash
./scripts/update.sh --zsh-only  # Update Zsh plugins
source ~/.zshrc                 # Reload configuration
```

**Homebrew packages missing?**
```bash
./scripts/update.sh --brew-only  # Update packages
```

**Neovim plugins not working?**
```bash
./scripts/update.sh --nvim-only  # Update Neovim plugins
```

## üîê Private Configuration

For sensitive environment variables (API keys, project IDs, etc.), use the private config file:

### Setup Private Config
```bash
# Create private config file (not tracked by git)
touch ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh
chmod 600 ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh

# Add sensitive variables
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"' >> ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh
echo 'export API_KEY="your-api-key"' >> ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh
```

The `.zshrc` automatically sources `~/.config/zsh/private.zsh` if it exists. This file should:
- **Never be committed** to version control
- Contain only sensitive environment variables
- Be created manually on each new machine during setup
- Be secured with proper file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh`

### Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: The private configuration system is designed to keep sensitive data OUT of the repository:

1. **Private files are stored locally**: All sensitive configs live in `~/.config/zsh/` on your machine
2. **Automatic exclusion**: A `.gitignore` file in `~/.config/zsh/` prevents accidental commits
3. **Machine-specific setup**: You must create `private.zsh` on each new computer
4. **No cloud sync**: These files should NOT be synced to cloud storage or shared

### What Goes in Private Config

```bash
# ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh - Examples of what belongs here:
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-key"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export DATABASE_URL="your-db-connection-string"

# Work-specific configurations
export WORK_EMAIL="your.work@company.com"
export COMPANY_VPN_CONFIG="/path/to/company/vpn"

# Personal API keys and tokens
export PERSONAL_GITHUB_TOKEN="your-personal-token"
export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN="your-brew-token"
```

### Setting Up Private Config on New Machines

When you set up dotfiles on a new computer, remember to:

1. **Create the private config file**:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh
   chmod 600 ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh
   ```

2. **Add your sensitive variables**:
   ```bash
   echo 'export YOUR_API_KEY="your-actual-key"' >> ~/.config/zsh/private.zsh
   ```

3. **Verify it's working**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   echo $YOUR_API_KEY  # Should show your key
   ```

4. **Confirm it's excluded from git**:
   ```bash
   git status  # private.zsh should NOT appear in untracked files
   ```
