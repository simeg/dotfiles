# My Dotfiles ![CI](https://github.com/simeg/dotfiles/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. My dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I master my life. My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless.
